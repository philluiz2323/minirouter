"""Light post-processing of a model output ``M_k`` into ``O_k`` (SPEC §4.5).

Per SPEC §4.5 the default post-processing is **pass-through with light
truncation**: keep ``M_k`` verbatim but cap it at a fixed character budget to
bound transcript growth across the up-to-K turns. No extra summarizer LLM call
is made (this keeps atomic-eval cost predictable).

When an output exceeds the budget we keep a head and a tail and elide the middle,
so both the early framing (plans, problem restatement) and the late conclusion
(final answer, ``VERDICT:`` line for verifiers) survive truncation. Keeping the
tail matters: the Verifier's verdict and the Worker's final answer live at the
end, and a head-only truncation would silently drop them.

Pure / deterministic / no LLM calls.
